# Salma Moustafa's Data Analysis Portfolio
This portfolio contains some of the projects I have worked on while completing my masterâ€™s in science in Computer Engineering in the Arab academy for science technology and maritime transport. It shows my experience using programs such as R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, SQL, and Tableau. Many of these projects highlight multiple skills needed by data scientists, such as problem identification, data exploration, data cleaning, data sampling, building predictive models, comparing models, data storytelling (communication), creating visualizations, and providing solutions to business problems. Some of these are group projects, for which they showcase my ability to effectively collaborate with others while developing data-driven solutions.

## Customer Churn Prediction 
###### https://github.com/sllamaa/churn-prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to the loss of customers over time, and being able to identify customers who are likely to leave enables businesses to take proactive retention measures. The dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, and contract details. Key steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## Spotify Charts
<link>
This project explores and analyzes global and regional Spotify Top 200 chart data to uncover trends in popular music. It involves examining song attributes such as genre, artist popularity, track duration, and chart performance over time. Through data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis, we identify patterns in hit songs, recurring artists, and country-specific preferences. The goal is to gain insights into what makes a song successful on streaming platforms.
